## TicTacToe

A very simple game everyone should know. 
I wrote it to test a few things out.
A human player plays against the AI.
Can you beat the AI? ;)

#### Version

This is the Python version of the game.
You can find the twin repo's written in **Java** and **C++** here on my github or directly https://github.com/SauronTs/TicTacToe-Java and https://github.com/SauronTs/TicTacToe

#### Things used
No graphics libraries. Only simple text output.
The AI decides their moves using the minimax algorithm, whereby the complete tree is computated and used.

#### Signing
Testing the commit signing for github.
